# Challenge01-bootcampDioSantander-iOS
First challenge from my DIO iOS BootCamp feat. Santander 2023!

teacher gave a challenge in Swift Playground:

- Create a Constant with initial value Steve;
- Create a Variable of optional string types and with initial value Jobs;
- Write a print doing interpolation with the constant and the variable defining a default value for the optional variable as "Wozniak";
- Make an Optional Binding on the variable and within the condition, make another print with interpolation between the constant and variable that was unwrapped.
